# Foundry Fundamentals course code

This repo contains code written (or copypasted when instructed) by me during the [Foundry Fundamentals course by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry/).

As opposed to the course, I collected all individual projects within a single repo to stay organized, as well as share .env variables, etc.
